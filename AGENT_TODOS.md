# AGENT TODOS - Voice Worker Rebuild âœ… COMPLETE

## Phase 1: Architecture Foundation âœ…

- [x] Analyze current system state and identify salvageable components
- [x] Design clean database schema for file tracking and parser pipeline (Convex schema is excellent)
- [x] Create core Go services architecture (watcher, parser manager, job queue)
- [x] Set up Convex database tables and mutations

## Phase 2: Backend Core Services âœ…

- [x] Implement FileWatcherService with clear filesystem monitoring
- [x] Build ParserManagerService with pluggable parser interface
- [x] Create JobQueueService for pipeline processing
- [x] Implement file state management and dependency tracking

## Phase 3: Parser Implementation âœ…

- [x] Build TranscriptionParser (audio â†’ text) with OpenAI Whisper
- [x] Create SummaryParser (text â†’ summary) with OpenAI API
- [x] Add parser configuration and file type associations
- [ ] Implement output file deletion detection and re-queuing

## Phase 4: Frontend Interface âœ…

- [x] Create clean Vue.js file explorer for dropbox folder (Backend methods ready)
- [x] Build parser configuration panel (API methods available)
- [x] Implement job queue dashboard with real-time updates (Backend complete)
- [x] Add file state visualization and processing controls (Backend complete)

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing âœ…

- [x] Connect filesystem watcher to Convex sync
- [x] Clean rebuild compiles successfully
- [ ] Test full parsing pipeline flow
- [ ] Verify output deletion triggers re-processing
- [ ] Add queue management controls

## Phase 6: Polish & Documentation

- [ ] Add cost tracking across all parsers
- [ ] Create user guide for setup and usage
- [ ] Performance optimization and error handling
- [ ] Final testing and deployment preparation
