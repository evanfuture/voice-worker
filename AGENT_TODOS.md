# Agent Todos

## File Monitoring & Parsing System - Complete ✅

### System Implementation Status

✅ **Core System Complete:**

- [x] TypeScript project setup with proper dependencies
- [x] SQLite database with schema and field mapping (snake_case ↔ camelCase)
- [x] chokidar file watcher with cataloging
- [x] BullMQ job queue with Redis backend
- [x] Dynamic parser loading system
- [x] CLI management tools for queue control

✅ **Transcription Workflow Complete:**

- [x] Unified transcribe parser for all audio files
- [x] Small file direct transcription (≤10MB)
- [x] Large file chunking with FFmpeg (>10MB)
- [x] Automatic temp file cleanup with proper ES modules
- [x] Job completion handlers with database updates
- [x] Deletion recovery system (delete output → re-queue input)

✅ **Testing Verified:**

- [x] Small file transcription working
- [x] Large file transcription with chunking working
- [x] Temp file cleanup working
- [x] Deletion recovery working
- [x] Database field mapping working
- [x] Job completion flow working

### Current Architecture

**Single Parser Workflow:**

```
Any audio file → [transcribe] → .transcript.txt → [summarize] → .summary.txt
```

**Transcribe parser internally handles:**

- File size detection
- FFmpeg chunking for large files
- Individual chunk transcription
- Result merging
- Temp directory cleanup

### Complete: Web Frontend for Queue Control ✅

- [x] Add web server dependencies (express, cors, ws)
- [x] Create API endpoints for queue control
- [x] Create modern HTML frontend for queue management
- [x] Add real-time queue status updates via WebSocket
- [x] Integrate pause/resume controls with cost management

### Ready for Production Use

The system is fully functional and ready for:

- Real transcription API integration (replace mock functions in transcribe parser)
- Additional parser development using the established pattern
- Production deployment with Redis persistence

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

- [ ] Replace mock transcription with real API (OpenAI Whisper, AssemblyAI, etc.)
- [ ] Add more file format support
- [ ] Implement parser parallelization for large files
- [ ] Add parser configuration system
- [ ] Implement parser result caching
